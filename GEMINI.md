# Gemini Context: NixOS Configuration

This directory contains the complete configuration for a NixOS system, managed using Nix Flakes.

## Project Overview

*   **System Hostname:** Overlord
*   **Primary User:** zeph
*   **Desktop Environment:** KDE Plasma 6 with SDDM as the display manager.
*   **Key Technologies:** The configuration uses Nix Flakes to manage dependencies and system configurations. It pulls packages from `nixpkgs-unstable`, `home-manager`, `chaotic-nyx`, and `nur`.

## Building and Running

*   To apply the configuration to the host system, run the following command from this directory:
    ```bash
    sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#Overlord
    ```
*   To update the flake inputs, run:
    ```bash
    nix flake update
    ```

## Development Conventions

*   The configuration is modular, with different aspects of the system configured in separate files (e.g., `gui.nix`, `services.nix`, `pkgs.nix`).
*   The `flake.nix` file defines the inputs and outputs of the flake, and the `configuration.nix` file is the main entry point for the system configuration.
*   Packages are managed in `pkgs.nix`.
*   User-specific configurations are in `users.nix`.
*   Services are defined in `services.nix`.
*   The graphical user interface is configured in `gui.nix`.

## Key Files

*   `flake.nix`: Defines the flake's inputs (dependencies) and outputs (the NixOS system configuration).
*   `configuration.nix`: The main NixOS configuration file. It imports other configuration files and sets system-wide options.
*   `pkgs.nix`: Defines the list of system-wide installed packages.
*   `services.nix`: Configures system services like `ollama`, `tlp`, `power-profiles-daemon`, etc.
*   `gui.nix`: Configures the graphical user interface, including the desktop environment (KDE Plasma 6), display manager (SDDM), and related packages.
*   `users.nix`: Configures user accounts and their properties.
*   `hardware-configuration.nix`: Contains hardware-specific configurations, typically generated by the NixOS installer.
